==============

Simulates ion trajectories in an RF only quadrupole device with arbitrary electrode geometry considering space charge and interaction with a flowing background gas. The electrode geometry and resulting electric field is defined by a set of SIMION potential arrays. The pressure / density and flow velocity of the background gas can be defined by spatially resolved fields, e.g. from an CFD simulation of the simulated device. 

.. warning::
    This application has to be revised. It can fail with an exception under certain conditions. 

.. note:: 
    Currently, no collisions of simulated particles with electrode surfaces are considered in this application and the RF frequency of the device is currently fixed at 1 MHz.

Paths to gas parameter fields and potential arrays
--------------------------------------------------

.. note::
    All file paths are relative to the simulation configuration file. 

``rho_field_file`` : File path 
    Path to background gas density (rho) field.

``flow_field_file`` : File path
    Path to background gas flow velocity field.

The potential arrays have to have the same geometric extend and are assumed to be normalized. The total potential at a location is calculated by a linear combination of the potentials: 

.. math::

    U = U_{\text{RF norm.}} \cdot V_{\text{RF}} + U_{\text{entrance norm.}} \cdot V_{\text{entrance}}

``electric_field_rf_file`` : File path
    Path to potential array for RF electrodes with normalized bipolar field for RF electrodes. 

``electric_field_entrance_file`` : File path
    Path to the normalized potential array for the entrance electrode.
