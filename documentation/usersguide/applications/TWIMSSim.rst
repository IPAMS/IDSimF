========

Simulates the trajectories of charged particles in a Traveling Wave Ion Mobility Spectrometry (TWIMS) Device, including background gas interaction, ion chemistry and space charge. 
A Traveling Wave IMS consists of a gas filled RF-only ion guide onto which a repeating waveform pattern is applied, resulting in a sequence of continuously propagating potential waves. Ions within the device can either be swept along by the wave, which is referred to as surfing, or they can be overtaken by the wave in so-called roll-over events. Ions are separated along the drift path due to their different electrical mobilities and their drift times can be measured to acquire a Mobility Spectrum.

The electrode geometry and potentials are defined through SIMION potential arrays. The potential wave is created by the combination of a waveform profile and a set of phase shifts which are applied to the electrode stack in a repeating pattern. This repeating potential pattern is then rapidly switched across the electrodes, leading to traveling potential waves.
Ions start uniformly distributed in a configurable start zone. The interaction between background gas and the ions can be described with different collision models. Electric ion-ion interaction (space charge) can be modeled with a parallelized version of a Barnes-Hut tree. 

The modeled ions are chemically reactive. The temperature dependent reactions of the individual chemical species are simulated with RS. The reactions are defined in an :ref:`RS configuration file <usersguide-rs-configurations>`. To simulate chemically inert ions, an RS configuration without reactions between the species has to be defined.

Potential Array Configuration
-----------------------------

The electrode geometry and potentials of the TWIMS electrode stack are defined through SIMION potential arrays. As TWIMS utilizes two different voltage patterns applied to the ring electrodes, the transient wave pattern and a confining RF-voltage, two sets of potential arrays are required.

The Traveling Wave pattern can be created across a variable number of electrodes that is defined by the number of potential arrays given, i.e. if 8 potential array files are given it is assumed that a single wave pattern encompasses 8 ring electrodes. 
The confining field is meant to prevent radial ion drift and is created by applying opposing phases of a RF-voltage to two adjacent electrodes, thus two potential arrays are required for the RF-field.

``potential_array_scale`` : float
    Geometric scaling factor for the potential arrays specified in ``potential_arrays``.
    
``wave_potential_arrays`` : Vector of file paths
    Paths to the SIMION potential array files defining the electrode geometry of the stack and the potentials of the transient wave. Typically, SIMION potential arrays generated with the *fast adjust* option are used for potential definition. 

    The potential arrays have to have the same geometric extend and are assumed to be normalized. The total potential at a location is calculated by a linear combination of the individual potentials. 

    The file paths are relative to the simulation run configuration file. 
    
``RF_potential_arrays`` : Vector of file paths
    Paths to the SIMION potential array files defining the electrode geometry of the stack and the potentials of the confining field. These potential arrays have to have the same geometry and electrode placement as the wave potential arrays.

Collision models and background gas interaction 
-----------------------------------------------

The simulation has different modes to model the interactions between ions and the background gas which are suitable for different background gas pressure ranges. 

The collision model mode is controlled by the ``collision_model`` parameter: 

``collision_model`` : keyword [``SDS``, ``HS``, ``MD``, ``none``]
    Sets the used collision / background gas interaction model: 

    * ``SDS``: Statistical Diffusion Simulation model
    * ``HS``: Hard Sphere model
    * ``MD``: Molecular Dynamics model
    * ``none``: No background gas interaction (mostly for testing purposes)

``background_partial_pressures_Pa`` : Vector of floats 
    Partial pressures of the individual components of the background gas mixture in Pascal. Note that with SDS background gas interaction model, only one background gas component is allowed. 

``collision_gas_masses_amu`` : Vector of floats
    Molecular masses of the particles of the background gas mixture components in amu. Note that with SDS background gas interaction model, only one background gas component is allowed. 

``collision_gas_diameters_angstrom`` : Vector of floats
    Effective collision diameters of the particles of the background gas components in Angstr√∂m. Note that with SDS background gas interaction model, only one background gas component is allowed.
